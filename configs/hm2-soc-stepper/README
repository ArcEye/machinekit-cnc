Axis is a modern, GL-based interface coded in python

Axis gui hm2-soc-stepper ini files:

5i25-socfpga.ini                    basic demo (DE10_Nano, DE0_Nano_SoC)
5i25-soc-cramps.ini                 9 axes
5i25-soc-cramps_no-fw-load.ini      For DExx boot time configured fpga (5i25 device named)
5i25-zynq.ini                       For Zynq boards
ultr-soc-cramps_no-fw-load.ini      For Xilinx Ultra96 (ultr device named)

Select one of these if you have no functional machine but want to edit some basic configuration stuff or play with one of the Machinekit displays.

These configurations demonstrate Machinekit functionality using the axis gui as the interface.  (The functionality demonstrated may be available in other guis also)
